SELECT emp_id,ename,salary FROM employee
WHERE salary<2600000 AND job_desc = 'MANAGER'; 

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc='ADMIN' OR job_desc='HR'; -- though this works next command is a much better choice

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc IN ('ADMIN','HR'); 

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc NOT IN ('MANAGER','CEO');

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE salary BETWEEN 2000000 AND 3000000
LIMIT 5; --limits the records shown 

SELECT * FROM employee
LIMIT 5;  -- Different syntax in oracle/sql server

Using Like and wildcards:

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'A%'; -- filters name starting with A

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'R%a'; -- filters name starting WITH R AND ending with a

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE '%I%'; -- filters name containing I

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE '__I%'; -- filters name with i as third character

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'R\%'; -- filters name starting with R%. \ is the escape character.
